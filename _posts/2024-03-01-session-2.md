<h2>Please provide a brief summary of your research: </h2>
Most of my research projects have been in the field of memory. I have conducted projects looking at which areas of the brain are most important for different types of memory e.g. spatial, temporal order, and metamemory (i.e. our ability to judge our own memory performance). Lesion symptom mapping was the main technique used to relate characteristics of brain lesions due to stroke, to performance on memory tasks. Another project focused on image memorability. The main finding of this project was that the more an image looks like a real human face the more memorable it is.

<h2>Please provide 1-3 reference articles related to your research and talk: </h2>

<h2>In your view, how will your research impact patients and clinical practice? </h2>
Hopefully, by understanding which brain regions are most important for different types of memory, future studies can examine whether stimulating this circuit could improve patients' memory.
