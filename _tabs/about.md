The <b> Neuro-Dialogue: from Bench to Bedside </b> talk series aims to create a vibrant platform that bridges the gap between neuroscience research and clinical practice. Our goal is to foster connections between scientists who are conducting groundbreaking research in neuroscience and the clinicians and clinician-scientists who apply this knowledge in real-world healthcare settings. By bringing these groups together, we encourage the exchange of ideas and insights, facilitating a deeper understanding of how basic scientific discoveries can directly impact patient care and clinical outcomes. Through this ongoing dialogue, we seek to inspire collaboration, spark innovation, and ultimately enhance the translation of scientific research into effective clinical practices.
